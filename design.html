                    This name card design reflects a minimalistic and personal aesthetic that aligns with my style. 
                    The color palette and typography are carefully chosen to convey elegance and professionalism. 
                    The logo "SQ" is an abstraction of my initials, while the name "Eirene" adds a thoughtful and symbolic touch. 
                    Derived from the Greek word meaning "peace," Eirene represents my commitment to creating harmonious and balanced designs. 
                    This project highlights my ability to combine meaningful elements into a cohesive visual identity.

                    This sticker set features Murata Himeko, a character from the video game Honkai Impact 3rd. 
                    The collection showcases Himeko in various outfits and hairstyles, with subtle variations in facial expressions. 
                    Each design is carefully crafted to capture the character's personality while maintaining consistency across the set. 
                    This project demonstrates my ability to adapt existing characters into a unique, creative format that is engaging and visually appealing. 
                    It's a fun exploration of bringing beloved game characters to life through design.

                    A basic low-fidelity replica of the Republic Polytechnic homepage, created as a small school exercise to practise essential Figma features. 
                    This prototype focuses on using simple shapes, alignment tools, text styling, and layout structure to recreate the main sections of the page without visual details. 
                    It reflects my understanding of fundamental wireframing techniques and how to translate an existing interface into a clean, minimal lo-fi layout.

                    This is a high-fidelity dark mode redesign of my final year project team’s original light-mode Campus Care app.
                    I recreated the full set of user and admin screens in Figma, adapting colours, typography,
                    and components to ensure proper contrast, visual clarity, and accessibility in low-light environments.
                    The design maintains full consistency with the original layout while introducing a refined dark colour system that enhances usability and comfort.
                    This work demonstrates my ability to translate an existing design system into a cohesive dark mode experience.
