                <p>
                    This name card design reflects a minimalistic and personal aesthetic that aligns with my style. 
                    The color palette and typography are carefully chosen to convey elegance and professionalism. 
                    The logo "SQ" is an abstraction of my initials, while the name "Eirene" adds a thoughtful and symbolic touch. 
                    Derived from the Greek word meaning "peace," Eirene represents my commitment to creating harmonious and balanced designs. 
                    This project highlights my ability to combine meaningful elements into a cohesive visual identity.

                <p>
                    This sticker set features Murata Himeko, a character from the video game Honkai Impact 3rd. 
                    The collection showcases Himeko in various outfits and hairstyles, with subtle variations in facial expressions. 
                    Each design is carefully crafted to capture the character's personality while maintaining consistency across the set. 
                    This project demonstrates my ability to adapt existing characters into a unique, creative format that is engaging and visually appealing. 
                    It's a fun exploration of bringing beloved game characters to life through design.
