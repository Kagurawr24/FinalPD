                <h3><b>Project description</b></h3>
                <p>This project involves creating a two-sided namecard with front and back designs.
                    Using computer vision integrated with Unity, the namecard serves as a marker.
                    When scanned through a compatible application, it triggers the display of a 3D model directly on the namecard,
                    regardless of which side is scanned. The project combines graphic design, 3D modeling,
                    and AR technology to produce an interactive and visually engaging experience.</p>

                <h3><b>Room 1 walkthrough</b></h3>
                <p>In the first part of the immersive VR game, the clues are revealed in the first half of the video. 
                    The order of the books is determined by the number of candles placed beside each one. 
                    The player then interacts with the books by clicking on them in the correct sequence, 
                    unlocking the door to progress to the next area.</p>

                <h3><b>Room 2 walkthrough</b></h3>
                <p>In the second part of the game, the puzzle is solved by pulling the sword out of the stone and using 
                    it to strike the monster. This action triggers the tombstone gate to open, allowing the player to proceed</p>

                <h3><b>Room 3 to ending walkthrough</b></h3>
                <p>In the final part of the game, the main gate is unlocked by finding skull candles of different sizes and 
                    placing them correctly on the skull. These candles are scattered throughout the area, 
                    with the last candle requiring the player to solve an additional puzzleâ€”unlocking a grave using a shovel. 
                    As shown, the player places the candles in the correct positions, which triggers the gate to unlock. 
                    Regarding the coding, I used pivot points to attach the skull candles to the skull.</p>
